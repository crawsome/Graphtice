# Graphtice
Pronounced like "Practice" but with "Graph" at the beginning. It's a better pun in concept than it rolls off the tongue.

This is an educational resource that I've been working on in my free time. I plan on adding more features and improving on it over time.

## What does it do?

It runs through [Lewis Carrol's Word Ladder Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_ladder) and [graphs it](https://i.imgur.com/qR33noj.png)

I'm currently still working on this project to make a more optimal way of graphing. It's currently drawing a sine wave.

I made this because I was learning about fundamentals in my free time:
* Traversal of nodes
* Graphing an attractive representation of the data
* Dynamically adding and removing from a graph
* Implementing some solutions to the "Wordladder" problem.
* Exporting a graph to a PDF or image

Please submit issues with wordpaths that it cannot find. 
More tests to come. This upload seems to find a really fast path for fool->sage at least. Need more test cases!

### Note:
Script needs write access to directory to save the PDF and the PNG of the graph, and read access to read the dictionary file.
